        abouttext: "I also dabble in UI design and Javascript programming. Educated in computer science and web development, I‚Äôve moved into the area of freelancing while working full time on web development for a printing company. I thrive on projects that aim to make a big impact on their industry through innovation and creativity.    In my free time I enjoy cooking, fishing, hiking and painting. Every year I participate in the Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk. In the past 5 years, my team and I have raised over $20,000 in the fight against cancer. Feel free to join us in the battle by clicking here.     Being an entrepreneur, I understand the challenges that businesses face when trying to market and promote themselves. I find it a benefit with my experience to put myself in the same position as others wanting incredible results, therefore generating the overall impact customers want. I love working with and getting to know talented people who are in need of creating interesting things. If that‚Äôs you, please get in touch!",
