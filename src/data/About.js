    "bio": "Hi, I’m Karla – a designer of multiple mediums varying from print to web. I also dabble in UI design and Javascript programming. Educated in computer science and web development, I’ve moved into the area of freelancing while working full time on web development for a printing company. I thrive on projects that aim to make a big impact on their industry through innovation and creativity. Being an entrepreneur, I understand the challenges that businesses face when trying to market and promote themselves. I find it a benefit with my experience to put myself in the same position as others wanting incredible results, therefore generating the overall impact customers want. I love working with and getting to know talented people who are in need of creating interesting things. If that’s you, please get in touch!"
